I conducted a SWOT analysis to understand the campaign's internal and external factors, and a PESTLE analysis to assess the broader market environment.

My role involved making strategic decisions across various business functions—from production and marketing to finance and sales—to compete against rival firms in multiple regional markets. I analyzed market data, adjusted pricing and product features, and optimized resource allocation to drive profitability and secure a competitive advantage. This experience provided practical, hands-on knowledge in small business management, highlighting the direct impact of strategic choices on a company's performance.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"project\">\n  <h3><a href=\"https://learningspace.myucw.ca/d2l/lms/dropbox/user/folders_history.d2l?db=153449&grpid=0&isprv=0&bp=0&ou=81106\" target=\"_blank\">Machine Learning Algorithms Project</a></h3>\n  <p>In this project, I utilized machine learning algorithms to analyze a dataset and build a predictive model. I began by performing data preprocessing to clean and prepare the data for analysis. I then selected and implemented appropriate machine learning models, such as linear regression or classification algorithms, to solve a specific problem, such as predicting customer churn or forecasting sales. I evaluated the performance of each model using key metrics and tuned the parameters to optimize their accuracy. The project demonstrates my ability to apply machine learning principles from data preparation to model deployment and evaluation.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"project\">\n  <h3><a href=\"https://learningspace.myucw.ca/d2l/lms/dropbox/user/folders_history.d2l?db=99434&grpid=0&isprv=0&bp=0&ou=51142\" target=\"_blank\">SQL Database Project</a></h3>\n  <p>For this project, I designed, built, and queried a SQL database to analyze political donations in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I began by creating the database schema, defining tables, and establishing relationships to ensure data integrity. After loading the dataset, I used Structured Query Language (SQL) to perform complex queries to identify key trends, such as donation patterns over time, the distribution of funds by political party, and contributions from various regions. The final deliverable was a comprehensive report and a set of query results that provided data-driven insights to inform strategic decisions. This project showcases my proficiency in database management and my ability to translate raw data into actionable business intelligence.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div>","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n<style>\n/* Page background */\nbody {\n  background-color: #d9d9d9; /* grey corners */\n  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 20px 0;\n}\n\n/* Content box */\n.container {\n  background-color: #001f3f; /* navy blue */\n  color: white;\n  max-width: 900px;\n  margin: auto;\n  padding: 30px;\n  border-radius: 12px;\n  box-shadow: 0 0 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);\n}\n\n/* Centered main title */\nh1 {\n  text-align: center;\n  font-size: 42px;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 20px;\n  color: white;\n}\n\n/* Project sections */\n.project {\n  margin-bottom: 18px;\n}\n\n.project h3 {\n  font-size: 24px;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  color: white; /* project name */\n  margin-bottom: 6px;\n}\n\n.project p {\n  color: white; /* project description */\n  font-size: 16px;\n  line-height: 1.5;\n}\n\n.project a {\n  color: white;\n  text-decoration: underline;\n}\n</style>\n\n<div class=\"container\">\n\n\n<div class=\"project\">\n  <h3><a href=\"https://learningspace.myucw.ca/d2l/lms/dropbox/user/folders_history.d2l?db=185580&grpid=0&isprv=0&bp=0&ou=97878\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix Advertising Campaign Analysis</a></h3>\n  <p>This project involved a strategic analysis of a Netflix advertising campaign, utilizing key frameworks to evaluate its effectiveness.
